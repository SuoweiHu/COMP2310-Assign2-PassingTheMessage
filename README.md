## Building

### GNAT Studio

To build in GNAT Studio, build or run the `test_routers` program.

### Manually

To build manually, run
```
gprbuild [-jN] [-Xmode=debug|release]
```

Set `N` to the number of files you want to build in parallel.

The scenario variables are as follows
- `mode`:
    Controls the level of optimisation and runtime checks built into the program
    - `debug` (default): Build with minimal optimisation and stricter runtime checks, good for debugging and low compile time
    - `release`: Build with high optimisation and looser runtime checks, good for testing performance of a correct program

For example, to compile a release build on 4 cores you can run:
```
gprbuild -j4 -Xmode=release
```

## Running 

### Configuration

Available network topologies are denoted by name together with the parameters which are required for a given topology. For example, you can test your routers in a 4-d hypercube by:

```
./build/debug/test_routers -t Hypercube -d 4
```

Use the help flag to print the full configuration parameters
```
$ ./build/debug/test_routers -h
